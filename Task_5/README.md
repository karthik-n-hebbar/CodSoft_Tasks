# ðŸ“‰ Data Science: Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ“‰

Thrilled to showcase my accomplishment in **CodSoft**'s Task 5 â€“ a rewarding journey into the world of data science, with a focused emphasis on Credit Card Fraud Detection. Guided by CodSoft's expertise, I dived into crucial aspects of data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation, all aimed at contributing significantly to the vital field of fraud prevention.

## Key Highlights:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Leveraged essential libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, to facilitate data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Data Collection & Processing**: Collected and processed the credit card transactions dataset, unveiling insights into its attributes and characteristics.

3. **Data Visualization**: Employed powerful visualization techniques to gain a visual understanding of transaction distribution, highlighting both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Explored the relationship between transaction amounts and classes.

4. **Feature & Target Separation**: Isolated key features (excluding 'Class') and the target variable ('Class') in preparation for subsequent modeling.

5. **Train-Test Data Split**: Thoughtfully partitioned the data into training and testing sets, a crucial step to ensure accurate model evaluation.

6. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trained two distinct models â€“ Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier â€“ specifically designed for fraud detection. Evaluated the performance of these models using the accuracy score and comprehensive classification reports.

This model stands as a sentinel, actively safeguarding financial transactions by efficiently identifying and preventing credit card fraud. Its role ensures the security and trustworthiness of payment systems, thereby bolstering the integrity of financial transactions.
