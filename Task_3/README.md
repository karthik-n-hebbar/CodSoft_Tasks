# ðŸŒ¸ Data Science: Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

Excited to showcase my accomplishment from **CodSoft**'s Task 3 â€“ a captivating exploration into the world of data science through Iris Flower Classification. Guided by CodSoft, I embarked on this journey, excited to showcase the power of data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:

- **Data Collection & Analysis:** I began by loading the Iris dataset, unraveling its characteristics through initial rows, summary statistics, and insightful information.

- **Feature Engineering:** Categorical species labels received a numerical translation, ensuring compatibility with modeling techniques.

- **Data Segmentation:** The dataset gracefully split into input features (x) and target labels (y) for focused analysis.

- **Train-Test Division:** The data thoughtfully partitioned, allocating subsets for both training and testing stages.

- **Model Training:** I harnessed the power of three distinct classifiers â€“ Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree â€“ nurturing their learning on the training data.

- **Performance Evaluation:** By casting predictions using the trained models, I discerned their prowess, quantified by accuracy scores on the test data.
