# ðŸ“ˆ Data Science: Sales Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

Thrilled to highlight my accomplishment in **CodSoft**'s Task 4 â€“ a dynamic exploration in data science, centered on Sales Prediction. Guided by CodSoft's expertise, I embarked on a journey to unlock the power of data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps:

1. Importing Libraries: Leveraged essential libraries to facilitate data analysis and modeling.

2. Data Collection & Processing: Collected and processed the sales dataset, gaining insights into its characteristics.

3. Data Visualization: Utilized visualization techniques to understand relationships between advertising channels and sales.

4. Feature & Target Separation: Isolated key features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target variable (Sales) for modeling.

5. Train-Test Data Split: Partitioned the data into training and testing sets for unbiased model evaluation.

6. Model Training & Evaluation: Trained multiple regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and evaluated their performance using the R-squared score.

This endeavor underscores the potential of data science in forecasting Sales, emphasizing CodSoft's role in nurturing a profound understanding of this fascinating field.
